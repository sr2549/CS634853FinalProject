# CS634853FinalProject

Here is the installation steps: (also founded in documentation)
Installation
 Note: I have provided two versions of the project, one with jupyter notebook and the other
 with .py files. The juypter file is a combination of two python files, one with model code and
 one with data visualizations based on the dataset. The juypter file takes select few of the
 data visualizations created in the python file and analyzes them. (The code may take some
 time to run)
